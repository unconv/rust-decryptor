# Rust Decryptor

This Rust program was created as a part of my YouTube video about learing Rust with ChatGPT. The program is inteded to be used with my WordPress Form Encryptor plugin. It is used to decrypt form fields that are encrypted with the plugin.

The program asks for a private key file (PKCS#8) and a Base64 encoded encrypted text. When these are provided and the "Decrypt" button is clicked, the encrypted text is decrypted and shown to the user.
